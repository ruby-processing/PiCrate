For a semi-automated setup and install, download and extract [this gist](https://gist.github.com/monkstone/6ae9840d7b7008c177b4a9f589d14ec6). To keep your system clean put the file in a folder say
`~/install_picrate`

```bash
cd ~/picrate_install
bash picrate2_install.sh # to run default task
```
#### What the script does ###
1. Downloads JRuby
2. Installs JRuby to `/opt`
3. Uses `update-alternatives` to configure `jruby`, `jgem` and `jirb`
4. The script checks for `GEM_HOME`, if undefined it modifies `~/.profile` to define `GEM_HOME` and puts gem binaries on your path, at logon.
5. Installs jdk11 if required sets `JAVA_HOME`, needed to support jruby
6. Creates `~/.gemrc` with `gem: no-document`
7. Installs `picrate` gem
To install `picrate_samples` also configures `geanyIDE` for use with `picrate` run
`picrate --install` in a bash console

#### Note ####
`GEM_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME` and path to `gem` binaries are not available until next logon, to use immediately you could:-

```bash
source ~/.profile
```
NB: this only works in current shell, so if you want to use `geanyIDE` you should logout and logon again.
